## What this project is about :woman_technologist: 

*OBS! IN PROGRESS*

I am currently working on this project to showcase my skills on both frontend + backend, making a fullstack application.

I wanted to create a "instagram for travellers". I myself, love to travel and connect with new people. The thought is to show places a person been to through both images and also text, to tip fellow travellers on genuine experiences.

**This is the CLIENT**

## User stories :notebook:

1.	As a user I want to be able to register with an email + password. 
2.	As a user I then want to be able to login to my profile page.
3.	As a user I am able to add images from my travels.
4.	As a user when I click on an image, I’m redirected to the that image description endpoint (/image/id).
5.	At the /image/id I’m able to add a description, edit my current descriptions and also delete a description.
6.	After editing/deleting/adding a description I click “save", I’m then redirected to the image board.
7. As a user I'm able to log out from my profile.
